## 2. Project Motivation
Traditional public goods funding systems face challenges in transparency, donor accountability, and community involvement. FUNDIFY addresses these challenges by providing:
- **Transparent Funding**: All transactions and fund allocations are visible on the blockchain.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Users participate in decision-making by voting on proposals.
- **Incentivized Engagement**: Contributors earn rewards, encouraging sustained community participation.

## 3. Key Features
### Decentralized Proposal and Voting System
- **Proposal Creation**: Community members can submit project proposals for public review and voting.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Token-based voting ensures that only verified community members have voting rights.
  

### Transparency and Auditable Transactions
- **Blockchain Transparency**: All transactions, including donations and fund allocations, are recorded on-chain for transparency.
- **Immutable Record Keeping**: Project progress, community votes, and funding decisions are auditable on the blockchain.

## 4. Technical Architecture
### Blockchain Platform
**Taiko** was chosen for deployment due to its scalability and low transaction costs, making it ideal for a community-driven platform.

### Smart Contracts
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.1.0**: Leveraged for secure and optimized contract standards.
- **Foundry**: Used for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts in an efficient, streamlined manner.

## 5. Smart Contract Overview
### Contract Structure
- **Fundify.sol**: Manages core platform functionalities, including proposal creation, voting, and funding.
- **Token.sol**: Defines the platform's native token, used for voting and rewards.
- **Escrow.sol**: Holds and releases funds for projects based on set milestones.

### Key Functions
- `createProposal`: Allows users to submit new project proposals.
- `voteOnProposal`: Enables token-holders to vote on active proposals.
- `fundProject`: Allows users to contribute funds, which are held in escrow until project milestones are met.
- `releaseFunds`: Automatically releases funds upon milestone verification.

## 6. Frontend Architecture
**Framework**: Built using Svelte for a responsive and lightweight user experience, the frontend enables users to easily navigate the platform and interact with key features.

### Core Components
- **ProposalDashboard.svelte**: Displays all active proposals and voting options.
- **FundingPage.svelte**: Shows project details and allows users to fund projects securely.
- **UserWallet.svelte**: Allows users to manage their tokens and view reward balances.

### User Flow
1. **Onboarding**: New users create a profile and connect their digital wallet.
2. **Proposal Submission**: Community members submit proposals with descriptions and funding goals.
3. **Voting**: Users view proposals and vote on projects they wish to support.
4. **Funding & Rewards**: Users fund projects, receive tokens, and track project progress.
